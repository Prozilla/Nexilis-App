# Nexilis
An alternative Reddit app built with React Native by Prozilla. The Nexilis app aims to provide a smoother and more customizable interface for Reddit.

Note: this app is still in its early stages and is currently only targeting iOS and web. The app may still work on Android but some features will certainly be broken.

## Usage
Because the Nexilis app was made using Expo, you can read the instructions on how to use it in the official [Expo docs](https://docs.expo.dev/).

## History
This is the app version of [Nexilis](https://nexilis.netlify.app/) [(repo)](https://github.com/Prozilla/Nexilis), a website powered by the Reddit API.
