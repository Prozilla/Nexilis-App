# Nexilis
An alternative Reddit app built with React Native by Prozilla. The Nexilis app aims to provide a smoother and more customizable interface for Reddit.

Note: this app is still in its early stages and is currently only targeting iOS and web. The app may still work on Android but some features will certainly be broken.

## Documentation
Each folder contains a README that explains its contents. Further documentation can be found in comments inside the code.

## Usage
First of all, you will need to change `reddit.clientIds` in `config.js`, the key of each entry represents a possible redirect URI, generated by the `makeRedirectUri()` function in `expo-auth-session`, each value represents the ID of your Reddit application (which can be created/configured at [reddit.com/prefs/apps](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps) that uses this redirect URI. This needs to be done because Reddit requires the `redirect_uri` property in the body of an authorization request to match the redirect URI of the Reddit application.

Lastly, to start using your modified version of Nexilis, you can refer to the instructions on how to use it in the official [Expo docs](https://docs.expo.dev/), because Nexilis was made using Expo.

## History
This is the app version of [Nexilis](https://nexilis.netlify.app/) [(repo)](https://github.com/Prozilla/Nexilis), a website powered by the Reddit API.
